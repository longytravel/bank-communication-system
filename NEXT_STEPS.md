# Next Steps for Cleanup - For Next Developer

## ‚úÖ What's Been Done
1. Removed unused navigation pages (Dashboard, Batch Processing, Cost Management, System Configuration)
2. Deleted Executive Dashboard functions from main.py
3. Made Customer Analysis modular (uses customer_analysis.py)
4. Fixed UI styling issues

## üî¥ Still To Do

### 1. Remove More Unused Code from main.py
- Delete old customer analysis functions if still there
- Delete batch processing route code
- Delete cost management route code  
- Delete system configuration route code

### 2. Delete Unused Files
```bash
# Delete these unused modules:
del src\communication_processing\batch_ui.py
del src\communication_processing\batch_planner.py
del src\communication_processing\cost_integration.py
del src\communication_processing\cost_controller.py

# Keep only test_system.py, delete:
del test_api_simple.py
del test_end_to_end.py
del test_rules.py
del test_professional_ui.py

4. Update Documentation
